    "### Why do we need uncertainty\n",

    "### Can we quantify if it's good PU or is that impossible\n",
    "By definition, uncertainty is a number quantifying unknowns about a thing. It is however possible to say something is 'good' unknowing vs 'bad' unknowing: \n",
    "Good unknowing would actually contain unknowns, while 'bad' unknowing would also ignore knowledge that we have. \n",

    "Maximum entropy principle should apply to Posterior the same way it applies to the Prior. In simple words, this means that the posterior should be as informative as possible while not making up additional information\n",
