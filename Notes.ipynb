    "On one hand, assessing different models that allow for the generation of predictive uncertainty should give pratictioners a handy way of deciding which approach is best suited to their current needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the evaluation of statistics for uncertainty assessment (who assesses the assessors) might be even more interesting of a topic than the first one."
